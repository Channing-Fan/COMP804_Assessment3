                Malware refers to malicious software designed to exploit devices
                for the attacker's benefit, often using stealthy techniques to
                avoid detection and gain unauthorised access.

                Ransomware encrypts victims' files and demands payment for their
                release. Rootkits open backdoors for further attacks. Trojans
                that masquerade as harmless programs, and spyware that secretly
                monitors and steals sensitive information.

                Ransomware attacks typically occur when a user visits a
                malicious website or opens a harmful email attachment, leading
                to the encryption of important files on the infected device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attackers then demand a ransom for the decryption key needed to
                unlock these files, and in some cases, they also threaten to
                sell or leak stolen data to increase pressure on the victims.

                Passwords remain the most common, yet vulnerable, method of
                authentication, making them a prime target for attackers seeking
                unauthorised access to systems and data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attackers use various methods to acquire passwords, including
                brute-force and dictionary attacks that guess passwords, social
                engineering tactics to trick users, and keylogging software that
                captures keystrokes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, they may use password sniffers on networks or
                steal password databases directly from organisations.

                A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack floods a target
                server or network with excessive traffic from numerous
                compromised devices, aiming to slow it down or crash it, denying
                service to legitimate users.
              </p>
              <p>
                These attacks are often motivated by political or ideological
                reasons, but some are conducted for ransom, with attackers
                threatening to launch a DDoS attack unless payment is made.

                The use of AI is increasingly enhancing the effectiveness of

                Phishing is a type of attack where an attacker pretends to be a
                trusted entity to deceive a victim into revealing sensitive
                information like passwords or credit card details.
              </p>
              <p>
                These attacks, often carried out via email, text messages, or
                phone calls, are based on social engineering and are highly
                effective and easy to execute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Variants include spear phishing, which targets specific
                individuals or companies, and whaling, which focuses on
                high-level executives.

                Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack where
                an attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website,
                which are then executed in the browsers of unsuspecting users.
              </p>
              <p>
                This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing
                session cookies, distributing malware, or defacing websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Often, XSS is combined with social engineering tactics like
                phishing to increase its effectiveness.

                A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack involves an attacker secretly

              </p>
              <p>
                The attacker can read, alter, and forward messages, potentially

                financial details.
              </p>

                These attacks are often aimed at online banking and e-commerce

              </p>
              <p>
                By altering parameters in the URL, such as user identifiers, the

                This vulnerability, often due to insecure direct object
                references, allows the attacker to exploit the site's failure to

                DNS spoofing attacks manipulate the Domain Name System (DNS) to
                redirect users to malicious websites by altering stored IP
                addresses.
              </p>
              <p>
                These fake sites closely mimic legitimate ones, deceiving users
                into providing sensitive information such as login credentials.
              </p>
              <p>
                The attackers then use this information to access the victims'
                real accounts on the targeted sites.
